                                            CSS Z-INDEX STACKING CONTEXT

### Intro
The stacking context is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes. (from MDN)

### How does it work
The DOM pages are actually full of stacking contexts - even the `<html>` element creates one; any position: fixed or sticky as well, and then a bunch of other ones like grid or flex children that do have an z-index other than auto. As a general rule - if a CSS property required rendering in an offscreen context, then it will create a new stacking context.

Important thing: Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context.

Motto: Gotta stack them right!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can???t go back!**

If you aren???t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you???re on your own.

You don???t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn???t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn???t be useful if you couldn???t customize it when you are ready for it.
